### Mechanism

1. Define what sustainability means to your project over a specified period of time.
2. Anyone can send funds to fulfill your sustainability.
3. Any surplus funds get redistributed back to sustainers.

Useful for facilitating next-generation contributer-driven business models, where a project's developer(s) and its community members can decide on a transaction fee or regularly-incurring subsription fee which decreases for everyone once the project reaches sustainability.

The thesis here is that the cost to develop, run, grow, and maintain global-scale software projects has become more and more predictable because we've abstracted and automated away so much complexity and variability behind cloud computing service providers and Ethereum. Meanwhile Twitter and GitHub happened, allowing a project's developer(s) and its community to exchange ideas and earn each others' trust more collaboratively, authentically, and iteratively. 

Today thanks to the internet, the developer <==> community relationship is all it takes to encourage productive behavior and sustain a sense of purpose towards a shared goal. The opportunity that arises is for a mechanism that ensures a valued project's sustainable growth while pushing each individual community member's price towards zero as the community grows. Sustainer's does this by allowing projects to publish what sustainability means to them for a specified duration ahead of time, and automatically redistributing surplus back to community members.

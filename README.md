## Mechanism

1. Define what sustainability means to your project over a specified period of time.
2. Anyone can send funds to fulfill your sustainability.
3. Any surplus funds get redistributed back to sustainers.

## Use cases

1. Useful for crowdsource funding for a specific single-time project where contributers know ahead of time how surplus will be allocated.

2. Extremely useful for routing business models through, so a company can regularly charge it's customers a transaction fee or monthly subsription fee which decreases for all users once the company reaches sustainability. The theory here is that software's ability to make money is now able to scale much faster than the cost to manage the growth. This creates an opportunity to both ensure the projects sustainability while pushing everyone's price towards zero as usage grows.

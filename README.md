###### An experiment in composable fundraising, income streams, surplus redistribution, and sustainable growth on Ethereum.

### Mechanism

1. Define what sustainability means to your project over a specified period of time.
2. Anyone anywhere in the world (or any smart contract) can send funds to help fulfill your sustainability.
3. Any surplus funds get redistributed back to sustainers proportionally.
4. Repeat, updating what sustainability means to you if needed.

### Overview 

Fountain is a new internet business model for funding open source internet services, public goods, micro finance, indy projects, and just about any initiative where the cost of execution is periodically recurring and mostly predictable.

The thesis here is that the cost to develop, run, grow, and maintain global-scale software projects has become more and more predictable as we've abstracted and automated away complexity and variability behind cloud computing service providers and Ethereum. Meanwhile Twitter and GitHub allow a project's developer(s) and its community to exchange ideas and earn one others' trust more collaboratively, authentically, and iteratively. 

Leaning heavily on the developer <==> community relationship, there's an opportunity for a mechanism that ensures each valued project's sustainable growth while pushing each individual community member's price towards zero as more people come on board. Fountain does this by allowing projects to premptively publish what sustainability means to them for a specified duration, and automatically redistributing surplus back to community members.

Ethereum also makes it easy for other smart contracts to integrate into Fountain, which makes two important things possible. First, projects can route their income stream through this contract as a means of competing in the market. Second, it'll be easy to create sustainability dependencies, so a project's sustainability can be algorithmically hooked up to that of projects it depends on. 

This mimics an overflowing fountain effect ⛲️ where a water stream directed at a top surface can end up overflowing the pools of each layer beneath, so long as the boundaries of the pools are defined ahead of time.  ️

This can also be useful for crowdsource fundraising.
